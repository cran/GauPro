Title: Gaussian Process Fitting
Version: 0.2.4
Author: Collin Erickson
Maintainer: Collin Erickson <collinberickson@gmail.com>
Description: Fits a Gaussian process model to data. Gaussian processes
 are commonly used in computer experiments to fit an interpolating model.
 The model is stored as an 'R6' object and can be easily updated with new 
 data. There are options to run in parallel (not for Windows), and 'Rcpp'
 has been used to speed up calculations. Other R packages that perform
 similar calculations include 'laGP', 'DiceKriging', 'GPfit', and 'mlegp'.
